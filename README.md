# Team Profile with Branches
## HFY M2/W1 Class Exercise #1

### About
This is a part of exercises done in class in the second module Incremental Development in HYF coding course. The objective is to get used to **creating branch and merge it to master** and to create the exact number of branches as per requested (n of members +1).

### How
After making a new repo, clone it, open it on visual code studio, the branch can be made directly from Github, or via GitKraken, or via Visual Code Directly (something called _fast forward merge?_).  
  
**The different is :**
* If you create a branch and merge it on Github and Gitkraken, **you can see visually that the branches** on on Gitkraken and Github 'Network' graph. You can see them open, containing your commit and close back again to master. BUT, _after you commit on your branch on GitKraken, push to Github, then your branch is counted!_ If you marge directly on Kraken after commit, the branch would not show up on Github (and it is not automatically deleted, maybe useful for changes in another time). If you merge branches via Github, there is an option to delete or to keep the branches, the choice is yours!
> This seems useful for me if you want to keep track of everything and if there are a lot of changes that you would do in your alternative branch.   
* However if you create a branch and merge it via Visual Studio Code, **you wont see the branches on your Gitkraken or Github 'Network'.** It means that the line would be still one straigth line with master due to the fast forward merge. And then the branches are just not there on GitHub either on the graph nor in number! 
> For me, this could be appropriate if the change is very small and little, so invisible branch is not necessary, for example: correcting bug or changing your phone number on the nav section, maybe?.  

### My Thought
I tried and started the repo 2-3 times because of the vanished or unrecorded branches.  On the other hand this exercise requires the exact number of branches recorded/kept. And so, finally I did it like how I wrote on the [How](#how) section above with GitKraken. At leats this how my experience was, some thoughts? please leave it on my issue! :smile:
